Programming's languages, Concepts & Tools
- Data structure & Algorithms
- GIT
- Immutability
- Event-driven system
- JavaScript
- Docker and Kubernetes
- VS Code (plugins, snippets, shortcut keys, command)
- Clouds like AWS (especially EC2, S3, Lambda)
- API / REST
- Different design patterns
- Webpack
- Cypress | Testing
- Jira | Project Management

Node.js
- npm audit
- npm outdated
- npm update
- npm ci instead of npm install

Security
Packages checking (snyl.io)
- Store creds in an environment variable and not in code
- CORS and CSRF
- Helmet package
- Input and display validation (forms, escaping HTML, JavaScript)
- Security testing
- Closing ports
- Rate limiting and limited attempts for login
- Encryption for sensitive data like passwords etc using secure crypto
- Use services like Cloudflare for DDOS
- Keeping Cookie secure
- Ability to block JWT using services like Redis


Debugging
- Learn Node debugger
- Learn postman
- Learn chrome inspect elements
- Use APM like a sentry

Working Smart
- Setup snippets for repeated and most used code
- Don’t reinvent the wheel and use node libraries to save time and cost
- Setup most needed/popular VSCode extensions like bracket pair colorizer
- Setup path alias to make code more robust/easier/cleaner

Testing
- Unit testing
- Include 3 parts in each test name
(1) What is being tested? For example, the ProductsService.addNewProduct method
(2) Under what circumstances and scenario? For example, no price is passed to the method
(3) What is the expected result? For example, the new product is not approved

- E2E / API testing using postman or cypress
- Dependency injection design concept
- Test Coverage
- Use test libraries like faker.js


Code Quality, Documentation, Error handling & Logging

Coding
- Follow ES6+ code guidelines

Linting
- Linting and follow a guideline like| Airbnb | Google | Custom

Logging 
- User logging libraries like Winston instead of console.log

Commenting
- Properly comment everything

Documentation
- Using swagger for API documentation
- Using JSdoc for code documentation
- Proper response and request structure through API’s
